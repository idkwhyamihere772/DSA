What is Data Structure ?
-> Data Structure is arrangement of data so that It can be used efficiently.

Why to use Data Structures ?
-> 1. these are essential ingredients in creating fast and efficient algorithms...
   2. they help to manage and organise data...
   3.they make code cleaner and easy to understand...



 ABSTRACT DATA TYPES : 
An Abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to .

*abstraction refers to hiding the complexity and showing only the essential features .

so as I understand it simply refers to a blueprint for a data structure. It tells you what you can do with the data (like add, remove, or search), but not how it does it.

like most of our phone apps ...

for example : 

we can take list as an abstraction ...

and List can be implimented in two ways 
1. Dynamic Array
2. Linked List

we would see about these in ahead notes and files 
here the thing is the List is an abstraction which is simply presented in front of us , we dont know whether it is an dynamic array or a linked list..

and just for more idea there are queue , stack and maps these all are structure types...
for basic knowledge 
*Queue simply refers to a real life Queue which means it would follow FIFO(first in, first OUT) like in real life scenario who comes first gets their work done first ..

*Stack simply means a tower of data and it follows LIFO (last in, first out) for example assume 10 plates placed over each other,  so the last plate u placed in top , u have to choose that first 
 it simply means which comes in last (like last plate) have to go out first.

*Maps for now understand this as we studied in discrete mathematics...
