DATABASE :

A database is an organized collection of data that you can easily access, manage, and update.

Data structures—like arrays, linked lists, stacks, trees, and graphs—are typically used in RAM (main memory).
RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile, which means all the data stored in it disappears once the power goes off or the system shuts down.
 It's super fast, but not meant for long-term storage.

So, where does a database fit in?
Most traditional databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle) store their data on hard drives or SSDs—non-volatile storage.
 This ensures your data survives between reboots and is permanently saved unless deliberately deleted.

DATA WAREHOUSE:

A data warehouse is a centralized system designed to store, manage, and analyze large volumes of historical data from multiple sources.
 It’s built specifically for business intelligence (BI) and decision-making, not for day-to-day operations like a regular database.

- In simple terms dataware house is basically managing past data differently so that the present data can be efficiently managed.

BIG DATA:

It refers to extremely large and complex datasets that are difficult to process using traditional data management tools.

* Database ,data warehouse and bigdata our different from datastructures no detailed explaination of these is required for now.

HEAP/STACK MEMORY:
HEAP MEMORY is a region of a computer’s memory used for dynamic memory allocation—meaning memory that’s allocated at runtime, not in advance.
 It’s different from STACK memory(LIFO), which is used for function calls and local variables.

 example- int* arr = new int[1000]; // Allocated on the heap

Key Characteristics of HEAP MEMORY:
Dynamically allocated: Memory is requested using commands like new (C++/Java) or malloc() (C), and released with delete or free().
Global access: Any part of the program can access heap memory via pointers or references.
Manual management: In languages like C/C++, you must explicitly free heap memory to avoid memory leaks.
STACK MEMORY is a region of memory that stores temporary variables created by functions.
 It operates in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner, meaning the last variable added is the first one removed.

 example- int arr[1000]; // Allocated on the stack
